# Perspective principles in desmos calculator

This project originated as a proof of concept for projective geometry in desmos graphing calculator, which does not feature 3D-capabilities by itself. It can be used to understand or demonstrate the principles of pinhole type cameras or perspective drawing techniques. It is not meant to be a full featured 3D-modelling application or raytracer. 

## Features
* adjustable orientation: focal lenght, shift, height, anzimuth, altitude
* perspective construction guides: center of view, horizon, station point, ground line, measuring points, horizontal and vertical measuring lines, cone of vision, ground level grid
* drawing functions: points, polygones, vanishing points, vanishing lines

Please **rather bookmark this site or the redirecting link below than the desmos URL** since the latter will change on updates!
